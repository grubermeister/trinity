BUILDING:

Make sure you've got 
    Go 1.25, 
    Ninja 1.13, 
    Dart w/ SDK 3.9 
    Protobufs 32.1
        protoc-gen-go 1.36
        protoc-gen-go-grpc 1.5
        protoc_plugin 23.0
    gRPC 1.76

installed.

I believe the following architecture for the backend should be sufficient:

Development:
SQLite + Pebble, Genji + Ristretto

Production:
MySQL + Dolt + Redis, MongoDB + Memcached
